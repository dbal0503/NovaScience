The NovaScience Grant provides students with the resources necessary to carry out projects in order to promote scientific culture, cultivate innovation within the corporate world, and educate the public and next generation of STEM students. 

Under the auspices of the NovaScience Grant, I conducted research and developed multiple Machine learning models that aimed to promote STEM education and inspire fellow students and members of the Vanier College community. The applications I developed provided students with an introduction to several key concepts in machine learning, such as Computer Vision, Image, Video, and Text Classification, as well as model explainability. This project not only enhanced my technical skills and knowledge, but also fostered a culture of scientific exploration and innovation within the local milieu, contributing to the promotion of STEM education and enthusiasm among the college community.
